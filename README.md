**PCGODOT** is a node-based Procedural Content Generation (PCG) framework for Godot 4, forked and expanded from the original **[Godot Flow](https://github.com/yabadabu/godot_flow)** project.

---

## ℹ️ Overview & Project Origin

`Godot Flow` provided a fantastic visual foundation: a node-based workflow inside the Godot editor. PCGODOT takes that core idea and expands it into a fully realized PCG framework for building levels, environments, encounters, and reusable generation systems directly in the editor.

For developers unfamiliar with modern PCG workflows, this kind of tech lets you build complex worlds and gameplay spaces visually through interconnected nodes instead of hand-placing everything or writing tons of custom one-off scripts. Think procedural dungeons, prop scattering, spline-based paths, room layouts, environmental dressing, gameplay logic, or even entire world-generation pipelines.

The goal is to build on what `Godot Flow` started and bring a more powerful, editor-driven visual PCG workflow to Godot 4. Something that feels approachable for indie developers, but flexible enough to support the kinds of procedural tools usually associated with larger engine pipelines.

## 🚀 Key Features & Additions

* **+110 Custom Nodes**: A robust suite of nodes covering math, spatial logic, expressions, queries, spawning, and generation workflows. Check out the full [PCGODOT Node Library Reference](demo/addons/flow_nodes_editor/doc/nodes_reference.md).
* **Interactive 3D Viewport Debugging**: Toggle 3D visualizations showing point positions, density gradients, scale, and rotations directly in Godot's editor (select a node and press **`D`**).
* **Searchable Data Inspector**: Spreadsheet/table inspector showcasing attributes at any node, with active highlighting linked back to the 3D viewport (select a node and press **`E`**).
* **Subgraphs & Loops**: Seamlessly nest graphs inside other graphs with local parameters, custom outputs, and array loops.
* **Redesigned UI**: A completely redesigned UI layout docking directly in the editor with quick-access popup search for node creation.
* **Auto-Reload Graph Cache**: Real-time monitoring of `.tres` graph files to invalidate editor caches and hot-reload changes instantly.
* **Core Tagging & Copy/Paste**: Standalone JSON-based copy-pasting of node selections, with dedicated metadata tags for advanced filtering.
* **Precompiled GDExtension Binaries**: Precompiled GDExtension libraries for Windows and macOS wrapping fast C++ KdTree and RTree spatial queries.

## 📂 Node Library Reference

PCGODOT organizes nodes into a clean category structure, expanded with custom Godot helpers. For detailed documentation on what each node does and to view their source code, see the **[PCGODOT Node Library Reference](demo/addons/flow_nodes_editor/doc/nodes_reference.md)**.

### 📁 Category Overview:
1. **Subgraphs & Control Flow**: Nested subgraphs (`subgraph.gd`), loops (`loop.gd`), inputs/outputs, branches, select nodes, and conditional switches.
2. **Metadata & Attributes**: Add/remove attributes, rename streams, filter attribute ranges, and manipulate tag collections.
3. **Math & Logic Ops**: Standard math operations (`math_op.gd`), curve/density remapping, custom expression parser (`expression.gd`), and aggregate reductions.
4. **Splines & Paths**: Sample spline paths, generate splines from point arrays, calculate distance gradients, and clip points by boundary polygons.
5. **Point Transformations**: Move, rotate, scale, and snap points to grid boundaries, prune overlaps (`self_pruning.gd`), or apply Lloyd relaxation.
6. **Assets & Spawning**: Spawn MultiMeshes, scene instances (`spawn_scenes.gd`), lights/GI nodes (`spawn_nodes.gd`), or apply point data properties to actors.
7. **Spatial & Physics Queries**: Perform spatial difference/intersection/union operations, trace raycasts, or check for physics collisions.
8. **Generators & Grid Nodes**: Draw coordinate grids, extract edge/corner boundaries, generate simplex noise, and build room-carving layouts.

## 🎨 Gallery & Showcases

### 1. Sampling Meshes (Discarding Hard Edges)
Distribute points across the faces of a 3D Mesh while pruning points near hard edges.
![Sampling Mesh](demo/addons/flow_nodes_editor/doc/demo_sample_mesh.png)

### 2. Random Subscenes Distribution (Forests & Paths)
Distribute different subscenes randomly along curves and paths using attributes, custom rotation-alignment filters, and scene scanners.
![Random Subscenes](demo/addons/flow_nodes_editor/doc/demo_random_subscenes.png)

### 3. Unified Filters & Category Popup
Browse nodes structured into standardized categories. Select filters such as `Filter Data by Attribute`, `Filter Data by Tag`, and `Filter Data by Type`.
![Filters](demo/addons/flow_nodes_editor/doc/demo_filter.png)

### 4. Proximity Sampling & Distance to Density
Sample points and scale their density values smoothly based on their distance/proximity to curves or splines.
![Distance to Density](demo/addons/flow_nodes_editor/doc/demo_distance.png)

### 5. Nested Subgraphs & Selection Collapse
Create nested graphs and easily collapse selected nodes into a reusable Subgraph.
![Subgraph Collapse](demo/addons/flow_nodes_editor/doc/demo_subgraph_popup.png)

### 6. Procedural Helical Colonnade & Rubble Scatter
Generate complex procedural architecture such as helical towers. Combines curve sampling with coordinate transforms, relative lintel placement, and duplicate scatter operations to create debris and rubble.
![Helical Colonnade](demo/addons/flow_nodes_editor/doc/demo_flashy_colonnade_v2.png)

### 7. Fall Guys Hexagons
Generate dynamic gameplay platforms such as the multi-colored hexagon grid inspired by Fall Guys. Use the **Random Color** node to assign random color attributes from a palette to a MultiMesh.

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

1. Copy the following folders from this repository into your Godot project's root:
   * `demo/addons/flow_nodes_editor`
2. Open your project in Godot: **Project** → **Project Settings** → **Plugins**.
3. Locate **Flow Nodes Editor** and toggle the status to **Enabled**.

---

## 🎮 Quickstart Guide

In a 3D Scene:
1. Create a `FlowGraphNode3D` node.
2. In the bottom dock panel, select the **Data Flow** workspace (appears when the node is selected).
3. Press **Shift+A** (or **Right-click**) inside the graph to open the **Add Node** search panel.
4. Add a generator like **Grid**, then connect it to **Spawn Scenes** or **Spawn Meshes**.
5. Press **D** on a selected node to toggle its 3D debug visualizer.
6. Press **E** to toggle the bottom **Data Inspector** spreadsheet.

## 🏗️ Building from Sources

If you want to compile the C++ wrappers (KdTree, RTree) yourself:

```bash
git submodule update --init
scons
```
The plugin's native C++ source lives under `demo/addons/flow_nodes_editor/native/src/`.
Bundled native binaries live under `demo/addons/flow_nodes_editor/bin/`. This repository currently includes the Windows editor binary and a macOS debug framework; build additional GDExtension targets before using the native extension in exports.
