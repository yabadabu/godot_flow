=== TODO
[ ] Demos
	[X] Wall of rocks, picking a random point on the top
	[ ] Path with random subscene, filter by attribute with rotations
	[X] Sample surface of a mesh, create flowers or similar in the horizontal ground
	[X] Mark an area with a spline, have a path remove all flowers
		[X] Change density based on the distance to the spline contour
	[X] Bridge
[ ] Support for multiple data in stream evaluation?
	[ ] Debug
	[ ] Generic Loop
	[ ] Node to group
	[ ] Node to split by condition/field
	[ ] Substruct will read all input nodes..
	[ ] partition
[ ] Subgraphs / Loops?
[ ] Add noise to position <-- Improve noise
[ ] Allow meta to define input requirements. Single vs Multiple/Accepted Types/Required
[ ] Spline sampling interior in non grid pattern
[ ] Allow to filter rows in the inspector
[ ] Support for Vector4/Color/PackedVector4Array -> Read SubAttributes / MathNode / SetAttribute / Use in Debug if exists
[ ] undo/redo
[ ] Test random colors for each node -> Graph Editor Settings
[ ] add_attribute, if output is single stream with a type, set the color. Maybe make it generic
[ ] Allow the popup menu to have sections. Custom SubGraphs/Resources/Folders maybe
[X] Hightlight the node being evaluated rather than the connections
[X] Do not update what it's not dirty
[X] Introduce the mesh/spline data type
	[X] NOdes of type Curve/Mesh
	[X] Node to gather
	[X] Node to create
	[X] Node to sample (the current one)
[X] Allow to bypass a node
[X] There is bug where transforms seems to be updating the input
[X] Math Node. Should hide inputs when not needed. Like Abs
[X] Volume Sample in 3D
[X] Remap node
[X] Add expressions node
[X] weighted sampling
[X] support for @last?
[X] Get N property as a independent value. Get first, get last, etc.
[X] Sampling mesh
[X] Allow the grid to have an offset/rotation or it's useless
[X] scan nodes, filter by class_name
[X] scan nodes, option to resize to node limits
[X] Support for copy/paste/clone
[X] Resource properties are correctly imported as Resources in the scan node
[X] Promote input pin to graph input
[X] Custom inputs values in the pcg node 3d, not in the resource
[X] Generate reduction of metrics. Avg, Min, Max, etc of a numeric stream
[X] Copy with offset N times. Export attribute
[X] Show performance numbers somewhere
[X] Merge node
[X] if condition is null/emtpy
[X] drop some streams
[X] Ctrl+C will not add a comment. Only if pressing C alone
[X] E will toggle the data inspector but also make data_visualization visible in the editor
[X] Distance to curve
[X] Sort a stream by some condition
	[X] Floats
	[X] Ints
	[X] Strings
	[X] How does it behave with multiple streams
[X] add_attribute, input is optional
[X] Math Node. Should be easier to add a constant +float/+int/-vector at least. Use make_vector for vector
[X] Improve self prunning so more objects are kept
[X] No need to regenerate the menu every time
[X] Hightlight the selector row from the inspector in the 3D
[X] Make vector from float's, maybe autopromote float -> vector3 
[X] Allow the inspector to show all outputs/inputs
[X] nodes to filter A/B
[X] Math Node. Accept a stream feeding a single size element -> Promote it
[X] Confirm if we are using PackedStringArray for streams of type Strings
[X] Confirm I can set values of the generated instances
[X] spatial operations
	[X] A minus B
	[X] A intersection B
[X] Remove self intersections
[X] When changing scene, the registered nodes should be removed
[X] Confirm I can use Index as part of the streams
