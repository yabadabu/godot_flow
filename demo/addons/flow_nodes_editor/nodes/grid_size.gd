# grid_size — HiGen Grid Size declaration node
#
# PURPOSE
# -------
# Tags the downstream section of a graph with a power-of-two cell size that a
# future FlowGraphNode3D partition mode will use to iterate cells.  Today the
# node is a pure pass-through with a side-effect annotation on the evaluation
# context; it does NOT partition, spawn sub-evaluations, or filter points.
# Graphs that include this node evaluate identically to graphs without it.
#
# ANNOTATION MECHANISM
# --------------------
# The declared cell_size is written to ctx.variables under the reserved key
# GridSizeNodeSettings.CTX_KEY ("__grid_size__cell_size").  A later partition
# scheduler can read that key at the start of FlowGraphNode3D.execute() (or
# after graph evaluation) to know the desired cell size for this graph tier.
# See docs/_roadmap_notes/higen_grid_size.md for the full integration plan.
